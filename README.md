# Paintings To Sounds

This is a python script that ingests an image (recommended an abstract painting), and generates a sound, expected to have rougly the same emotional effect as the image. Attributes align as follows:

* Busyness informs frequency
* Image size informs number of harmonies
* Brightness informs whether the harmonies are major or minor
* Redness, as anger, informs strength of feedback
* Blueness, as sadness, informs the period of applied affects
* Greenness, as happiness, informs the size of the chorus affect

This project got first place at an art-and-music hackathon, and as a result I received an Oculus VR headset, which I now use to view abstract paintings to my heart's content
